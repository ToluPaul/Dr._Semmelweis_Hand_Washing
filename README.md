# The Discovery Of Hand Washing
Usefulness Of Hand washing discovered by Dr. Semmelweis

Everyone sees the need for the hand-washing because of the knowledge of the existence of bacteria, but in an era where bacteria had not been discovered how did they survive?

Oh well thanks to Dr. Semmelweis for taking time to analyse the occurence of the rise in death cases in his region as of the time. And particularly with the rise of death in women due to a desease called the childbed fever.

The jupyter notebook file in this repository contains a comprehensive and extensive description of the data analyzed and the process carried out in order to attain the final conclusion.

A basic line graph displayed showed the trend in death and the periodical time interval of the range in death scenarios. Python pandas library makes it very easy to work with date_time values and use them for data analysis

With the line graphs the effect of handwashing can easily be depicted with the before and after scenarios of which there is  a massive difference in death rate after instructing people to wash hands.

## Not all heros are recognized in the very end. 
After the wonderful change and save in lives Dr. Semmerlweis theory was not accepted even as there was no candid explanation of the relationship between hand-washing and saving of lives due to the fact that bacteria had not been discovered and there was no valuable proof as to the effect of handwashing.
